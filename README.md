# S.-alterniflora-removal-detection
 
1. we proposed a fully automated method based on GEE(Google earth engine) for rapid monitoring of S. alterniflora removal timing and status(removal/no removal) in large-scale coastal wetlands by integrating time-series Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery.
2. Developed by Yukui Min,  If you have any question ,please email to 2210902155@cnu.edu.cn

3. Result display in Shandong and Fujian
